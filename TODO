- We need a Role for Moose::Meta::TypeConstraint to define the interface we are decorating
- we need a Role or some way to detect when there are parameters attached to the type

??Do we need some sort of Factory for controlling the creation of types?

Moose::TypeConstraint->create_base(%opt);
Moose::TypeConstraint->create_structured(%opt, %signature_opts);
Moose::TypeConstraint->create_parameterized(%opt, %);

Or some sort of pattern for type constraints that accept args?

then a ...->create(%opt) that chooses one of the above????
